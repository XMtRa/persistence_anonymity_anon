We decided to not exclude people who missed the questionnaire at T2, as participation wasnâ€™t necessary for our analyses and would have only led to unnecessary dropouts.

We originally planned to use default (flat) priors (chains = 2, iterations = 2,000, warm-up = 1,000). However, to improve convergence, we increased chains to 4, iterations to 6,000, and warm-up to 2,000.
